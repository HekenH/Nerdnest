            C and C++ are considered foundational programming languages. Learning these languages provides a solid understanding of programming fundamentals, including variables, data types, control structures, functions, and memory management.
            C++ programming language is almost everywhere around the world. For example, it is used for making browsers, applications, and software. Also, C++ is used majorly to make operating systems, and almost all operating systems are built using C++, for example, Mac Os, Windows, Linux, etc.

                    C and C++ are known for their performance and efficiency. They provide low-level control over hardware resources, enabling programmers to write code that executes quickly and consumes minimal memory. This makes C and C++ well-suited for developing applications where performance is critical, such as real-time systems and resource-constrained environments.

                    C++ is widely used in the game development industry due to its performance and object-oriented features. Many game engines, such as Unreal Engine and Unity, are built using C++ and provide extensive APIs for game development. Learning C++ opens up opportunities to work on game projects and develop interactive experiences.
